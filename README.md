# Spotifinder
## Purpose
This repository highlights some of the code I wrote to create Spotifinder, a website that output song, album and playlist recommendations based on user input. It was created in collaboration with a few of my friends from class for a group project. I mostly handled the back-end database design, data manipulation, and query development and optimization.
## Languages
- Python (Pandas, JSON, Drive)
- SQL
- JavaScript
## Set-Up Guide
Unfortunately, the servers used to host and run the website have long been shut down, but I still wanted to highlight some of the work I completed for this project, as I am very proud of it!
